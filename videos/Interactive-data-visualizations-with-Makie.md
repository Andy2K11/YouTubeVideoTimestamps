abstract: |
    Makie.jl is a Julia-native interactive data visualization library. In this workshop, participants will learn how to create complex interactive and static plots, using the full range of tools Makie has to offer. Topics could include writing custom recipes, understanding the scene graph, mastering the layout system, handling complex observable structures and tweaking visual styles. The workshop will also be an opportunity to learn about the architecture and underlying ideas of Makie.
